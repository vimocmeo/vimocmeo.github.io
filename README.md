## 😄 Fun fact

Did you know that mindfulness can change the structure of your brain? According to a study published in the Psychiatry Research journal, participants in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program showed increased gray matter density in the hippocampus, a brain region associated with learning and memory, and decreased gray matter density in the amygdala, a brain region associated with anxiety and stress.
